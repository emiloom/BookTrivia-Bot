# BookTrivia-Bot
## A Discord Bot created with Java, Javacord API, and online trivia database

**Add bot to server using [this link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1004848023525937313&permissions=8&scope=bot) and test it out!**

Future improvement: host the bot on a server that can stay on

Questions vary from multiple choice, to true or false.

## Bookworm
- Sending "bookworm" to a channel, when the bot is active, will make the bot send a book trivia question. 
- To answer the question, send "Trivia Answer: " followed by the answer.
